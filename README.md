# Sports Facility Management System - Capstone Project 2021

The Sports Facility Management System (SFMS) is an integrated access control system. It is designed to provide sports facilities and their clients with a hassle-free, energy saving solution for booking, access and management of facility resources.

The system was designed to address issues some sporting centers face, such as: inefficient antiquated booking systems and increased operational costs incurred in 24/7 use.

Many sporting facilities lose potential revenue due to :
* Limited operating hours
* Operational costs of continuous resource use outweigh profits 
* Staff requirements for maintenance and monitoring
* Inefficient antiquated booking systems

The sports facility management system allows online bookings based on time and availability. It also automates access to the booked facility using a userâ€™s RFID card.
